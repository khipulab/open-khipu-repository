# The Open Khipu Repository

This open source digital repository stores the most up-to-date recorded data and metadata on extant Inka-style khipus from archaeological sites in the Andes, as well as museums around the world.

Currently, data is stored in a serverless SQLite relational database and contains all khipu data recorded and published by major Inka khipu scholars: Robert and Marcia Ascher, Hugo Pereyra, Harvard's Khipu Database Project (Carrie Brezine and Gary Urton), and Jon Clindaniel.

This repository is currently being developed and maintained under the direction of Jon Clindaniel (jclindaniel@uchicago.edu).
